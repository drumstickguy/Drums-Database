# Drum's Malware Database
My very own database, that will be owned by multiple people.

# Note 1
Make sure you are using these for entertainment purposes only. 

# Note 2
We recommend using a safe environment to try these malwares. They are indeed dangerous, some safe, but if something goes wrong with your PC, DO NOT BLAME US!!!

# For the contributors and requesters
Mkw sure the file is covered in a .exec format, for batch files however, .batc.
